You find yourself abandoned in the forest
you start to hiss at a bug in fear.


And you eat the bug.
You find yourself in a broken van.
Your owner must of forgotten of you.
Or maybe something happened to him...

You start to investigate and eventually find blood.
You scream in fear and try to stay warm.
And then you hear something behind you.
